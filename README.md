# üö® Smart Manhole Monitoring System

This project is a prototype system designed to monitor manholes in urban areas using sensors for **gas detection**, **water level**, **tilt**, and **intrusion detection**. It provides two implementations:

- üåê **Wi-Fi Web Dashboard** using ESP32
- üì± **GSM-Based SMS Alert System** using ESP32 + SIM800L

It looks like my browsing tool is temporarily down, so I can't access your GitHub repository directly. However, I can still give you suggestions based on what a well-structured GitHub repository for an IoT project like **"IOT-based Manhole Detection and Monitoring System"** should include.

Since you've uploaded **Arduino IDE code**, **website files**, and the **project report**, here's how you can organize and improve your repository:

2. **Project Description**

"An IoT-based system to detect hazardous manhole conditions using gas, water, tilt, and IR sensors. The system can alert users through SMS (GSM) or live dashboard (WiFi)."

3. **Features**

* Gas detection using MQ sensors
* Water level sensing with ultrasonic
* Tilt detection for open or misaligned covers
* IR-based presence detection
* Sends SMS alerts using SIM800L
* WiFi dashboard interface using ESPAsyncWebServer

4. **Hardware Used**

List your components:

* ESP32 Dev Module
* MQ-2 Gas Sensor
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* Tilt Sensor
* IR Sensor
* SIM800L GSM Module
* SSD1306 OLED Display (optional)
