# 🚨 Smart Manhole Monitoring System

This project is a prototype system designed to monitor manholes in urban areas using sensors for **gas detection**, **water level**, **tilt**, and **intrusion detection**. It provides two implementations:

- 🌐 **Wi-Fi Web Dashboard** using ESP32
- 📱 **GSM-Based SMS Alert System** using ESP32 + SIM800L

It looks like my browsing tool is temporarily down, so I can't access your GitHub repository directly. However, I can still give you suggestions based on what a well-structured GitHub repository for an IoT project like **"IOT-based Manhole Detection and Monitoring System"** should include.

Since you've uploaded **Arduino IDE code**, **website files**, and the **project report**, here's how you can organize and improve your repository:

---

2. **Project Description**

> "An IoT-based system to detect hazardous manhole conditions using gas, water, tilt, and IR sensors. The system can alert users through SMS (GSM) or live dashboard (WiFi)."

#### 3. **Features**

* Gas detection using MQ sensors
* Water level sensing with ultrasonic
* Tilt detection for open or misaligned covers
* IR-based presence detection
* Sends SMS alerts using SIM800L
* WiFi dashboard interface using ESPAsyncWebServer

#### 4. **Hardware Used**

List your components:

* ESP32 Dev Module
* MQ-2 Gas Sensor
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* Tilt Sensor
* IR Sensor
* SIM800L GSM Module
* SSD1306 OLED Display (optional)

#### 5. **Circuit Diagram**

Upload your schematic image (from Fritzing or any tool).

#### 6. **How to Use**

Give setup instructions:

```bash
1. Clone the repo
2. Upload the desired .ino file using Arduino IDE
3. For dashboard version: Connect to WiFi and open IP in browser
4. For GSM version: Insert SIM and power module properly
```

#### 7. **Screenshots**

Add images of:

* Dashboard web interface
* Hardware prototype
* SMS alert messages

#### 8. **Demo Video (Optional)**

Embed a YouTube link showing your project in action.

#### 9. **Contributors**

Mention team members who worked on this project.

### ✅ Suggestions for YAML

If you asked "what is YAML," here’s a quick explanation:

**YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language)** is a human-readable data format used often for:

* Configuration files (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
* Metadata in software
* Docker, CI/CD pipelines, etc.

You don’t **need** YAML unless you’re using GitHub Actions (e.g., auto-deploying your code, running test scripts, etc.).

If you share specific feedback you'd like (e.g. on `README.md`, Arduino code optimization, or web UI), I can help tailor improvements more closely.

Would you like me to help you **write a sample README** for your repo?
